        'All golf club hosts are required to agree to WedgeAwayâ€™s Terms & Conditions, which state that all listings are accurate.

        'WedgeAway holds your credit card information just in case a club you are using is damaged. Both you and the seller will be required to submit photos and a written statement about the damage and incident. If you (the renter) is at fault, we will assess the damage and the market value of the club. You will be charged market value for the damage caused to the club.',

      question: 'Can I extend my rental during my trip?',

We will of course always do our best to accommodate you and any special requests!',

      question: 'What happens if I lose a club?',
